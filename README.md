# Django-Portfolio
Just hosted my first portfolio site, obv work in progress though. I only even started learning django 5 days ago and coding whatsoever two months (not focused on web dev), 
if anyone actually happens to come across this and has any suggestions for what I could/should add or might like, etc. Always more more than happy to hear about it.
Most of my time goes towards my AI Engineering studies, so learning the intracacies of web design isn't rly at the top of my list tbh.
